# No Show Customers_Medical Appointments

## Dataset

[Medical Appointment No Shows]('https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments') has 100,527 medical appointments with 14 variables (features). By using this dataset, we tried to investigate who is going to miss the appointment and which features made them miss the appointment days. 

## Summary of Findings

Based on our dataset, we found interesting things below:

1. One out of five missed appointments on the dataset.  

2. We explored what differences between show-up group and no-show group have. For **show group**, patients showed up even though they did not get SMS reminders. We found that if **no-show patients** did not get SMS reminders before their schedule, they are more likely to not show up. SMS reminders would be an important factor that leads people to show up on their schedule dates. 

3. We also found 10s and 20s are more likely to not show up on their schedule dates. 

4. Finally, when people made an appointment on the same day for schedule date, they are more likely to show up on their schedule dates.
